# üîπ Step 1: Generate a Unique Blog Topic
def generate_blog_topic():
    prompt = """
    Generate a unique, search-optimized blog post topic for a holistic blog written in the tone of an female spirtual healer.
    The topic must be chosen from one of the following ideas:

    - Clairs (clairvoyance, clairsentience, clairaudience, claircognizance)
    - Human senses and energy shifts
    - Healing with Selenite and it's benefits
    - Intuitive art therapy for healing and self-discovery
    - 13 moon cycles and divine feminine energy
    - Ancient mayan 13-day calendar and it's meaning and how history intentionally erased it
    - Mary Magdalene, apostle of apostles, and that she was Jesus' wife 
    - Sacredness of the number 13
    - 13 chakras 
    - 13 DNA strands 

    Ensure the topic also provides **practical applications**, such as:
    - Exercises or techniques the reader can try
    - How to integrate these teachings into daily life
    - Real-world examples of transformation through these practices

    Please ensure the title does not always default to something like "intuitive art therapy: unlocking self healing through creativity". Choose a different topic if possible.

    The title should short, simple and clear to engage readers while being search-friendly. Return the title as plain text (without quotations) and nothing else.

    chakra activation.

    Key Guidelines for Clarity:
    - Use simple, engaging language.
    - Offer practical applications readers can apply to their lives.

    - Use structured formatting with only H3, and H4 headings.
